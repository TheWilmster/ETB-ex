As a warning, neither this decompiler nor even UTMT can be perfect.
There's likely gonna be some stuff you're gonna have to fix on your own.

Most notably asset indices. GameMaker stores assets referenced in the code as just numbers,
and the decompiler would have to GUESS which variables are for assets and which aren't.

If the game runner had an icon, you should use Resource Hacker to get it.
The script isn't exactly good at that either.
